# PairedJourney
2 Player 2D Level-based puzzle game I have started working on <br>

This project is currently under the works, but all commits of most recent work are made here <br>

This is a public repository mainly for the usage of working on my personal project from both my laptop and my desktop PC, as I am currently working alone and have no other need for a public repository <br>

If you happen to have any question about my project, I would be more than happy to asnwer them. <br>
I would be more than happy to collab with any artists as well looking for a game developer to work with. <br>

You can reach me reliably at drseaverson@gmail.com <br>
